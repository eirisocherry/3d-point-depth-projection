# 3D Point Depth Projection

Is an After Effects tool that allows you to quickly extract 3d coordinates and place any object to it.  
Requirement: Depth map and 3d camera data.

## Installation
1. Download the tool: https://github.com/eirisocherry/3d-point-depth-projection/releases  
2. Move the `3D Point Depth Projection` folder and `3D_Point_Depth_Projection.jsx` script to:  
`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels`  
3. Move the `SimpleLight.aex` plugin to:  
   `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC <version>\Support Files\Plug-ins`  
4. Restart After Effects.  



## Usage

<details>
<summary> Setup </summary>
<br>

1. Open After Effects.  
2. Go to `Window`, scroll down and open `3D_Point_Depth_Projection.jsx`.  
3. The script panel will open. It's dockable.  
4. Import a 3d camera data.

COD4: https://github.com/gmzorz/MVMAETools/blob/main/Support%20Files/Scripts/ScriptUI%20Panels/MVMTools.jsx  
5. Import a depth map of your composition.    
6. Select the depth map and setup a projection by pressing **[+]** button.  
7. Adjust **'Depth settings':**  
**'Black is Near'** check it if a black color is near on your depth map, uncheck if it's not.  
**'Far'** the farthest depth point value:  
CSGO (if you use my cfgs): `4096`  
COD4: `4080`  
EXR Depth: set the same value you set in EXtractoR  
8.  Project any objects you want.  

- The script is heavy and may crash your After Effects, but don't worry!  
It automatically saves your project before doing any actions, so even if your AE will crash, you will not lose any of your progress.  
- 'Auto Orient' works only with EXR depth maps.

<summary> SimpleLight </summary>
<br>

When you project 'SimpleLight' it makes a dublicate of your 'Depth for Projection' layer and applies 'SimpleLight' plugin to it  

`[x] SL` SimpleLight settings:  
**'Black is Near'** takes value from '3D Point Depth Projection' effect  
**'Far'** takes value from '3D Point Depth Projection' effect  
**'FOV'** links to your camera FOV  
**'Light (View Space)'** links to a point light `----[x] SL Light----`  
**'Light Range'** range of the light  

`[x] SL Adj` Adjustment Layer settings:  
It uses SimpleLight `[x] SL` as a luma mask  
**'CC Toner'** allows you change the color of the light  
**'Exposure'** allows you to change the brightness of the light  

`----[x] SL Light----` Point Light settings:  
'Color' links to the 'CC toner' effect, which is applied to `[x] SL Adj`  

'Projection settings' are self-explanatory.

<summary> Keyframes </summary>
<br>

When you project 'Keyframes', they are being stored in the 'Collected Keyframes' group

<summary> Solid </summary>
<br>

When you project a 'Solid', it takes properties from 'Projected Solid' and color from 'Projection settings'  
`Ctrl + Shift + Y` to open 'Solid' settings

Auto-orient Y-rotation only expression by [Dan Ebberts](https://www.motionscript.com/design-guide/auto-orient-y-only.html):  
```

<summary> Link-Bake </summary>
<br>

If you want to adjust position & orientation of an object:  
1. Press [âš™] button.  
2. Select 'Depth for Projection' and layers you want to make controllers for.  
3. Press [Link] button and adjust positions.  
4. To apply changes, select controllers and press [Bake] button.

<summary> Merge Depth </summary>
<br>

To merge depth layers, select them and press [Merge Depth] button.  
It will create a 'Merged Depth' solid with adjustment layer which uses 'Merged Depth' solid as a luma mask.  

Since 'Merged Depth' uses links to the depth layers you've selected, all the changes you make for them will be automatically applied to 'Merged Depth'.
